The sampling approach involved creating a hold-out set by randomly splitting the development data into 90% training and 10% validation, preserving temporal and feature distributions. An out-of-time (OOT) sample was separately drawn from non-overlapping time periods, including pre- and post-COVID phases, to evaluate model stability over time.
