For model training and validation, the sampled data from EWS was randomly divided into two subsets: 90% for training and 10% for validation. This random sampling ensured the preservation of the original class and temporal distributions within the development data. The model was trained on the 90% training subset and hyperparameters were tuned using the 10% validation subset. The test dataset was not drawn from this sample; instead, it was selected from the remaining scoreable population that was not included in the development sample. This separation ensured an unbiased evaluation of the modelâ€™s generalization ability on truly unseen data.
