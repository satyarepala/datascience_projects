benchmarking assessment was conducted between two vendors – Mitek and AuthenticID – to evaluate their capabilities across multiple dimensions such as liveness detection, deepfake selfie detection, fraud detection, manual review process, geographic coverage, document support, and reported reliability.

AuthenticID offers a faster response time (6 seconds, aiming for 2.5 seconds in 2025) with a fully automated process, while

Mitek provides a manual review team to handle unsupported documents and quality issues.

Both vendors provide liveness and deepfake detection, but AuthenticID uses passive liveness and is PAD2 iBeta certified.

Fraud detection methods vary: Mitek emphasizes velocity checks and injection attack defense; AuthenticID supports SOR checks and fraudshield integration.

Reliability and coverage were also considered, with both supporting a wide range of countries and standard identity documents.


This comparison helped in understanding each vendor’s strengths and trade-offs for the final selection decision.
