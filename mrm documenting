Hereâ€™s a more concise version with five key aspects:


---

As model specialists, our team is responsible for the following key aspects of model governance:

1. Model Development and Documentation

Ensuring all models are built on sound methodologies, with comprehensive documentation covering assumptions, limitations, and intended use.



2. Model Validation and Performance Monitoring

Regularly validating models for accuracy and robustness, while continuously monitoring their performance to ensure they meet business needs.



3. Model Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Identifying potential risks in model usage and implementing controls to mitigate those risks, ensuring models operate within acceptable limits.



4. Regulatory Compliance and Governance

Ensuring adherence to regulatory guidelines (e.g., SR 11-7) and maintaining strong model governance frameworks across the organization.



5. Ongoing Review and Revalidation

Periodically reviewing models to ensure their effectiveness, adapting them as necessary to reflect changes in data, business objectives, or regulatory requirements.
