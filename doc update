Sensitivity analysis assesses the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent approvals and rejections across various document types and countries. The following results highlight key fraud detection metrics, including the number of approvals, false approvals, uncaught fraud rate, total rejections, true rejections, and caught fraud rate. By analyzing these metrics, we evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to differentiate between genuine and fraudulent documents, ensuring optimal decision-making thresholds. These insights help refine fraud detection mechanisms and improve the overall reliability of the system.
