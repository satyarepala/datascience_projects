The metrics in the table represent the performance of an identity verification system (Mobile Verify Auto) for USA Cards across different score bands. These metrics are commonly used in classification models to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the system. Here's what each metric means:

TP (True Positive):

The percentage of genuine (authentic) documents correctly classified as authentic.
A higher TP means the system is effectively identifying genuine documents.
FN (False Negative):

The percentage of genuine (authentic) documents incorrectly classified as fraudulent.
A high FN rate means the system is rejecting too many valid documents, which can frustrate legitimate users.
TN (True Negative):

The percentage of fraudulent documents correctly classified as fraudulent.
A higher TN means the system is successfully detecting fraud.
FP (False Positive):

The percentage of fraudulent documents incorrectly classified as authentic.
A high FP rate indicates a security risk, as fraudsters are getting through the system.
Understanding the Score Band:
The Score Band represents the confidence level of the model in determining authenticity.
A lower score (e.g., 0–400) has higher TP but also higher FP, meaning more fraud might be slipping through.
A higher score (e.g., 800–1000) has higher TN but also higher FN, meaning fewer fraud cases pass through, but more genuine documents are mistakenly rejected.
Key Observations:
At score band 0, all fraudulent documents (100% FP) pass through, making it highly unreliable.
At score band 500, the balance between TP (86.67%) and TN (90.65%) looks reasonable, but FN (13.33%) and FP (9.35%) still exist.
At score band 1000, almost all fraud is blocked (0% FP, 100% TN), but almost all genuine documents are rejected (99.99% FN), making it too strict for practical use.
