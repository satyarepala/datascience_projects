*"We understand that the face comparison model is proprietary; however, for documentation purposes, we request some high-level technical details. Specifically, could you confirm the type of deep learning model employed, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a fully connected network, or any other architecture? Additionally, we would appreciate clarification on the network design—whether it follows a Siamese architecture, triplet network, or another framework—and the type of loss function utilized (e.g., contrastive loss, triplet loss, cross-entropy).

Furthermore, without disclosing sensitive architectural specifics, a general overview of the model structure—such as the number of layers, key components (e.g., convolutional blocks, dense layers), and activation functions—would be helpful."*



*"Could you provide details on the multi-layered anti-spoofing mechanisms implemented in the model? Specifically, we would like to understand the types of liveness detection techniques used—whether they are active (e.g., blink detection, head movement) or passive (e.g., texture analysis, reflection detection).

Additionally, it would be helpful if you could share examples of the specific methods or technologies applied at different layers of the anti-spoofing framework to enhance security."*

This version is concise, professional, and clearly guides the vendor to provide relevant details with examples. Let me know if you'd like to tweak it further.
