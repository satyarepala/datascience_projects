In the context of your use case, where the model predicts whether an ACH deposit will return or not, an Information Value (IV) of 2.67 indicates that the predicted score (the output of the model) has a strong ability to differentiate between deposits that will return (label 1) and those that will not (label 0). This high IV suggests that the model's predicted scores effectively capture the likelihood of a deposit returning, with the feature providing significant information about which deposits may face issues. A value of 2.67 indicates that the predicted score is a highly informative and predictive feature, making it a crucial element for decision-making and model performance in identifying potentially problematic deposits.
