The KS statistic of 0.29 suggests that the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes—deposits that will return and those that will not—is somewhat limited. A KS value of 0.29 indicates a moderate level of separation between the cumulative distributions of the two classes, but there is considerable overlap. This means the model does have some capacity to differentiate between the classes, but the distinction is not as strong as it could be. Generally, higher KS values indicate better separation, so the current value suggests that the model’s predictive power in identifying deposits that will return is still modest.


The predicted probability column, with an Information Value (IV) of 0.92, shows a moderate ability to differentiate between deposits that will return and those that will not. This IV value indicates that the model’s predicted probabilities offer useful information, but the strength of the distinction between the two classes is not very strong. An IV below 1 suggests that while the predicted probabilities help identify the likelihood of a deposit returning, they are not the most dominant factor in the model’s predictive performance. In this case, the predicted probability provides valuable insights into deposit return risks, but there is room for further enhancement to improve its ability to more clearly separate the two classes. Overall, the IV of 0.92 indicates that the predicted probabilities are moderately effective in assessing the likelihood of deposit returns, making them a significant, though not decisive, feature in the model.
