Primary Input to the Model

The model takes the following primary inputs to perform Face Liveness Detection, Face Matching, and Forgery Detection:

1. Live Face Image or Video

Captured through a user’s camera during the application process.

Used for liveness detection (to check if the face is real) and face matching (to compare with the ID document).



2. Identity Document Image

A scanned or photographed copy of an official ID (e.g., passport, driver’s license).

Used for OCR-based text extraction and forgery detection (to identify tampering).



3. Extracted Text Data (via OCR)

Text extracted from the identity document, such as name, date of birth, document number.

Compared against user-provided data for consistency.



4. Metadata from Images/Videos

May include information such as resolution, lighting conditions, and image compression artifacts.

Used for fraud detection (e.g., detecting whether an image has been digitally altered).

Automated Quality Checks: The model may automatically flag low
