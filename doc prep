Model Purpose and Intended Use

The Identity Verification (IDV) Model facilitates real-time identity verification in circumstances where the business determines that external verification methods are necessary to authenticate a client's identity. It is designed to detect fraudulent identity documents, assess document authenticity, and perform biometric identity matching.

As part of this process, an image of the client's government-issued identification is captured and analyzed to assess authenticity. The model evaluates the document's integrity, detects potential tampering, and ensures that the individual presenting the document is the rightful owner.

Based on the assessment, the business decides on account eligibility:

Passing Verification Score: If the identification receives a passing score, the client may proceed with the account opening process.

Failing Verification Score: If the identification fails verification, account opening is deferred until the client pursues the appropriate remediation as prescribed by the business.


The primary objectives of the IDV model include:

1. Forgery Detection

Identifies fraudulent modifications or tampering in identity documents.

Uses classification techniques to analyze machine-readable zones (MRZ), barcodes, and document structures.



2. Face Liveness - Presentation Attack Detection

Detects various presentation attacks such as 2D masks, printed cutouts, 3D masks, screen replays, and mobile replays.

Ensures that the user presenting the identity document is physically present at the time of verification.



3. Face Liveness - Deepfake Detection

Identifies synthetic images and videos generated using AI-based deepfake techniques.

Prevents identity spoofing through manipulated facial images.



4. Face Comparison

Compares the portrait image in the identity document with a live selfie submitted by the user.

Uses biometric verification techniques to confirm that the individual in the document matches the live subject.



5. Identity Document Classification

Determines the document type (passport, driver's license, etc.) and country of issuance.

Utilizes deep neural networks and classification techniques for document recognition.



6. Data Extraction from Identity Documents

Extracts textual information from machine-readable zones (MRZ) and barcodes.

Uses OCR techniques to retrieve human-readable information from identity documents.



7. Authentication Model

Aggregates scores from multiple verification modules (document authenticity, face matching, liveness detection) to generate a final authentication decision.

Incorporates ensemble learning techniques, including traditional regression models and advanced machine learning methods like XGBoost.




The IDV model operates within a controlled and secure environment to maintain data integrity and compliance with regulatory standards. By integrating multiple verification techniques, it enhances fraud detection accuracy and minimizes the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access.
